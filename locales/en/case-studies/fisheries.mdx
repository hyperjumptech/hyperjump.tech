## Overview

A growing fisheries startup faced a familiar challenge: a passionate but inexperienced tech team, inexperienced leadership, and a critical mission. Digitize Indonesia's fisheries supply chain from coast to customer. The stakes were high, but the potential impact was massive.

With no live product and a team just finding its feet, the company partnered with Hyperjump under a **[CTO-as-a-Service](https://hyperjump.tech/id/services/cto-as-a-service)** model to build strong technical foundations, processes, and culture.

## The Challenge

- The tech team had no working software in production
- Product ownership was scattered, and sprint ceremonies were more ritual than practice
- There was no clear roadmap, no scalable infrastructure, and major gaps in senior technical leadership
- Cross-functional collaboration and quality control were inconsistent

## Our Approach

Working closely over 12 months, Hyperjump embedded with the product, engineering, and operations teams. Here's what we delivered:

### Agile Overhaul

- Implemented real Scrum discipline, clear Definition of Done, structured grooming, and meaningful retrospectives
- Introduced the Fibonacci-based story point estimations and velocity tracking, enabling better planning and delivery

### From Zero to Launch

- Delivered an MVP of the mobile app, 'Heroes', within 3 months, outperforming the internal team in a friendly development competition
- Released new features every 2-4 weeks with CI/CD pipelines, Firebase crash reporting, and automated testing

### Engineering Maturity

- Introduced unit testing, code coverage (70%+), and CI pipelines via GitLab
- Consolidated version control into a single-trunk Git strategy with branch protections and structured naming conventions
- Enabled daily production-ready deployments across Web, Android, and ERP backends

### Full-System Rollouts

- Supported multiple ERP go-live deployments across regions, with integrated backend (Odoo) and mobile systems for tracking sales, inventory, and expenses
- Deployed a search-enhanced inquiry system tailored for multilingual buyers across markets, including Mandarin localization

## Key Learnings

- Well-defined processes matter more than individual talent in the early stages
- Technical debt happens, but must be managed. By identifying debt early, the team avoided snowballing rework
- QA isn't a department—it's a shared cultural commitment
- Documentation is your secret weapon. A growing internal wiki and consistent Jira practices made onboarding and scaling smoother

## What's Next

The team is now stable and self-sufficient. The next challenge is to strengthen internal leadership and establish a long-term product roadmap to keep delivering value at scale. We're proud to have helped this fisheries company build not just software, but a high-performing tech organization that's ready to transform the industry.
