## Overview

A growing fisheries startup faced a familiar challenge: a passionate but inexperienced tech team, green leadership, and a critical mission. Digitize Indonesia's fisheries supply chain from coast to customer. The stakes were high, but the potential impact was massive.

With no live product and a team just finding its feet, the company partnered with Hyperjump under a CTO-as-a-Service model to build strong technical foundations, processes, and culture.

## The Challenge

- The tech team had no working software in production
- Product ownership was scattered, and sprint ceremonies were more ritual than practice
- There was no clear roadmap, no scalable infrastructure, and major gaps in senior technical leadership
- Cross-functional collaboration and quality control were inconsistent

## Our Approach

Working closely over 12 months, Hyperjump embedded with the product, engineering, and operations teams. Here's what we delivered:

### Agile Overhaul

- Implemented real Scrum discipline,clear Definition of Done, structured grooming, and meaningful retrospectives
- Introduced Fibonacci-based story point estimations and velocity tracking, enabling better planning and delivery

### From Zero to Launch

- Delivered an MVP of the mobile app, 'Heroes', within 3 months. Beating the internal team in a friendly 'build-off'
- Released new features every 2-4 weeks with CI/CD pipelines, Firebase crash reporting, and automated testing

### Engineering Maturity

- Introduced unit testing, code coverage (70%+), and CI pipelines via GitLab
- Consolidated version control into a single-trunk Git strategy with branch protections and structured naming conventions
- Enabled daily production-ready deployments across Web, Android, and ERP backends

### Full-System Rollouts

- Supported multiple ERP Go-Lives across regions, with integrated backend (Odoo) and mobile systems for tracking sales, inventory, and expenses
- Deployed a search-enhanced inquiry system tailored for multilingual buyers across markets, including Mandarin localization

## Key Learnings

- Strong process beats strong people at first. With the right rituals, even a junior team can ship serious software
- Tech debt happens, but must be managed. By identifying technical debt early, the team avoided snowballing rework
- QA isn't a department, it's a culture. A shared commitment to quality reduced defects and increased confidence in releases
- Documentation is your secret weapon. A growing internal wiki and consistent Jira practices made onboarding and scaling smoother

## Results

The team is now stable and self-sufficient. The next challenge? Strengthen internal leadership and establish a long-term product roadmap to keep delivering value at scale
We're proud to have played a part in helping this fisheries company build not just software, but a high-performing tech organization that's ready to transform the industry
