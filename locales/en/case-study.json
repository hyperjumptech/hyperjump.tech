    "title": "Transforming a Fisheries Tech Team into a Scalable Product Engine",
    "text": "Empowering a mission-driven startup to digitize Indonesia’s fisheries supply chain—coast to customer.",
    "desc": "A junior but passionate tech team. Zero products in production. High impact at stake. We embedded deeply with their team to introduce structure, build confidence, and ship a functional MVP within 3 months. Through rigorous agile practices and full-system rollouts, we helped evolve a fragile tech org into a reliable product engine.",
    "overview": "A growing fisheries startup faced a familiar challenge: a passionate but inexperienced tech team, green leadership, and a critical mission—digitize Indonesia's fisheries supply chain from coast to customer. The stakes were high, but the potential impact was massive. With no live product and a team just finding its feet, the company partnered with Hyperjump under a CTO-as-a-Service model to build strong technical foundations, processes, and culture.",
    "challenge": {
      "1": "The tech team had no working software in production.",
      "2": "Product ownership was scattered, and sprint ceremonies were more ritual than practice.",
      "3": "There was no clear roadmap, no scalable infrastructure, and major gaps in senior technical leadership.",
      "4": "Cross-functional collaboration and quality control were inconsistent."
    },
    "approach": "Working closely over 12 months, Hyperjump embedded with the product, engineering, and operations teams. Here's what we delivered:",
    "agile_overhaul_1": "Implemented real Scrum discipline—clear Definition of Done, structured grooming, and meaningful retrospectives.",
    "agile_overhaul_2": "Introduced Fibonacci-based story point estimations and velocity tracking, enabling better planning and delivery.",
    "from_zero_to_launch_1": "Delivered an MVP of the mobile app, 'Heroes', within 3 months—beating the internal team in a friendly 'build-off.'",
    "from_zero_to_launch_2": "Released new features every 2–4 weeks with CI/CD pipelines, Firebase crash reporting, and automated testing.",
    "engineering_maturity_1": "Introduced unit testing, code coverage (70%+), and CI pipelines via GitLab.",
    "engineering_maturity_2": "Consolidated version control into a single-trunk Git strategy with branch protections and structured naming conventions.",
    "engineering_maturity_3": "Enabled daily production-ready deployments across Web, Android, and ERP backends.",
    "full_system_rollouts_1": "Supported multiple ERP Go-Lives across regions, with integrated backend (Odoo) and mobile systems for tracking sales, inventory, and expenses.",
    "full_system_rollouts_2": "Deployed a search-enhanced inquiry system tailored for multilingual buyers across markets, including Mandarin localization.",
    "key_learnings": {
      "1": "Strong process beats strong people—at first. With the right rituals, even a junior team can ship serious software.",
      "2": "Tech debt happens—but must be managed. By identifying technical debt early, the team avoided snowballing rework.",
      "3": "QA isn't a department, it's a culture. A shared commitment to quality reduced defects and increased confidence in releases.",
      "4": "Documentation is your secret weapon. A growing internal wiki and consistent Jira practices made onboarding and scaling smoother."

    "results": {
      "text": "The team is now stable and self-sufficient. The next challenge? Strengthen internal leadership and establish a long-term product roadmap to keep delivering value—at scale.",

    "title": "Elevating a Media-Tech Engineering Team from Feature Factory to Innovation Powerhouse",
    "text": "Helping a leading digital media platform shift from reactive delivery to strategic innovation.",
    "desc": "When rapid growth outpaced engineering maturity, this team needed more than features—they needed transformation. We restructured their agile practices, automated DevOps, established measurable KPIs, and helped them move from task execution to true product ownership and experimentation.",
    "overview": "A prominent digital media platform catering to Millennials and Gen Z was growing rapidly—but its engineering team wasn’t keeping pace. The team was excellent at shipping features on request but struggled to evolve into strategic innovators capable of leading product and technology transformation. To shift gears from reactive to proactive development, they brought in Hyperjump to support the transformation with a structured, hands-on approach.",
    "challenge": {
      "1": "Despite having a solid work ethic and collaborative company culture, the engineering team functioned more like an internal agency—handling feature requests from business units with minimal structure or tracking.",
      "2": "No task management or ticketing systems",
      "3": "Feature requests often went directly to individual developers",
      "4": "Lack of metrics to measure performance or progress",
      "5": "No agile ceremonies or standardized development processes",
      "6": "As product demand surged, the business needed more than execution—they needed innovation."

    "ci_cd_transformation_3": "Developers could now focus on innovation, not infrastructure.",
    "quality_assurance_1": "Reorganized the QA team into a structured, cross-functional unit.",
    "quality_assurance_2": "Testing became a mandatory release step, with better knowledge sharing and coverage planning.",
    "kpi_growth_1": "Developed clear internal quality metrics (defects caught during QA, unit test coverage) to improve maintainability and reduce tech debt.",
    "kpi_growth_2": "Tracked external quality metrics (production defects) to ensure faster issue resolution and service reliability.",
    "kpi_growth_3": "Teams gained visibility into their strengths and growth areas.",
    "centralized_feedback_1": "Set up a proper service desk system to collect bug reports and feedback from business units.",
